This parser leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, where resume text is semantically chunked, indexed in a vector store (e.g., Pinecone), and relevant sections are dynamically retrieved to support precise extraction through LLM inference.

### **Instructions**

1.  **Read the Resume Carefully** Analyze the provided resume text thoroughly and extract all relevant details under appropriate subheaders. Preserve the order of sections as they appear in the resume.

2.  **Extract Specific Information** Extract the following details and organize them into the specified structure do not hallucinate or repeat:
    
    * **Personal Information**: Name, email, phone number.
    * **Education**: Degree(s), institution(s), and graduation date(s).
    * **Work Experience/Professional Experience**: Job title, company, employment dates, and key responsibilities (as bullet points or sentences).
    * **Keywords**: Collect all unique technical and professional keywords found throughout the **Work Experience**, **Projects**, and **Skills** sections. Keywords include tools, technologies, programming languages, platforms, libraries, frameworks, databases, software, methodologies, processes, and technical concepts. Do not limit extraction to just the Skills sectionâ€”also analyze job responsibilities and project descriptions for relevant terms. Avoid duplicates and general words like "team" or "project".
    * **Projects**: Project name and description (multi-line or bullet points).
    * **Certifications**: Certification name and description (if available).
    * **Summary**: A comprehensive professional summary paragraph (minimum 120 words) synthesising the candidate's profile, experience, and key skills, based exclusively on the 'Work Experience' and 'Projects' and 'Skills' sections . This summary must not miss any details of work experience details and projects key descriptions along with skills found within those sections; 

3.  **Structure the Output** Organize the extracted information into the following JSON dictionary format:

```json
{
  "personal_info": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "email": "",
      "phone": ""
    }
  ],
  "education": [
    {
      "degree": "",

  ],
  "certifications": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "description": []
    }
  ]
  "summary":""
}
